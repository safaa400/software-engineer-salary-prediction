# Software-engineer-salary-prediction
In this project , my objective is to predict software engineers salary based on various features like the country , years of experience and the education level .I
performed all steps from choosing the data to be used till making a web app for my model using streamlit . I compared various machine learning model ; linear 
regression , Decision tree regressor and random forest regressor on the basis of mean squared error . At the end , random forest regressor had the best results . 

# Screenshots

Here is a screenshot for the models results and another one for boxplot for the the salaries based on  countries .
